"""
The *pathspec* package provides pattern matching for file paths. So far
this only includes git wildmatch pattern matching (the style used for
".gitignore" files).

See "README.rst" or <https://github.com/cpburnz/python-path-specification>
for more information. Or you can always scour the source code.
